# Lab 1: GitHub and Online Data Science Resources

### GitHub
**Overview** <br>
GitHub is a cloud platform used to upload, store, share, and collaborate on code for a wide variety of topics and uses. This allows users to showcase their work, maintain a log of changes over time, and collaborate with other people on a project without negatively impacting existing work. This is done through an extensive version control framework that allows users to store a "current" version of a project, with the ability to access a local copy to then modify/update it with the cloud version serving as a backup if any errors occur. It also provides valuable opportunities to review/receive input on projects and have discussions on any bugs or improvements needed. It also provides other services such as frontend website hosting for personal/original websites and/or code/markdown files through web services as opposed to a local file. This allows users to utilize it for an e-portfolio for technical career applications or even some graduate school applications/opportunities.

**Users:** GitHub is primarily used by developers to store/work on programming projects, and it is utilized both in academics and industry by students, professors, and business professionals to show off their work or utilize it for professional efforts.

**`clone` vs. `pull`** <br>
`git clone` downloads a copy of a repository onto a local machine to work, whereas `git pull` updates this local copy with any new commits that were previously pushed to the remote repository (such as a collaborator’s commit). 

### Sample Data Source: [The Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)
The Census Bureau provides large datasets covering demographic, economic, and standardized geospatial geometry data for the United States. It covers a variety of granularity from the entirety of the United States to state-level, county-level, etc; it also includes some data for native territories and US territories.

Census data can be utilized for a wide variety of projects, but it is especially useful for efforts or research in policymaking and planning efforts. Its demographic data helps determine political and boundary organization by providing population density information--this is used as a basis for the proportion/number of representatives allocated to each state as well as district boundaries for/within states. It can also help provide greater insights on target groups and/or regions for different programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, or SNAP/EBT by collecting identifying factors such as race, income, etc.

The Census also provides the geometries for different boundaries such as states, counties, and block groups, which can be combined with other datasets to effectively map and visualize information.
