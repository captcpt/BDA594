# Lab 1: GitHub and Online Data Science Resources

### GitHub
**Overview**
**`clone` vs. `pull`** <br>
`git clone` downloads a copy of a repository onto a local machine to work, whereas `git pull` updates this local copy with any new commits that were previously pushed to the remote repository (such as a collaborator’s commit).

### Sample Data Science Book: [Theory and Applications for Advanced Text Mining](https://www.intechopen.com/books/2746)
This book covers advanced text mining techniques, including the conceptual, mathematical, and technical bases and techniques to extract, process, and develop models with text data. It also provides many different examples and applications of these techniques and text mining in the general field of research. It includes the following chapters:
